## 1.1. Requirements

Clang UPC is know to work on the following platforms
(with LInux/x86_64 being the main development and
test platform):

**OS**|**Architecture**
Linux    | x86_64/amd64 |
Linux    | x86          |
Linux    | PowerPC      |
FreeBSD  | x86_64       |
Mac OS X | x86_64       |

<br/>
Building Clang UPC requires [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)
or [GNU Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
tools (configure).  Please see the [LLVM
documentation](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#requirements)
for a list of any further system requirements.

## 1.2 Downloading Sources

Clang UPC sources are managed in the git repositories on
[GitHub](http://github.com/Intrepid).  At minimum, two
repositories (llvm-upc and clang-upc) must be acquired
(cloned).  For example, if _src_ is a directory for Clang
UPC source, the following commands can be used to clone
Clang UPC sources:

<pre>
 git clone git://github.com/Intrepid/llvm-upc.git src
 cd src/tools; git clone git://github.com/Intrepid/clang-upc.git clang
</pre>

Optionally you can also choose to install Clang based 
UPC to C translator:

<pre>
 cd src/tools/clang/tools; \
 git clone git://github.com/Intrepid/upc2c upc2c
</pre>

The maintainer of Clang UPC also provides stable releases
of the Clang UPC.  Please visit the [download](/download) page
for the list of available downloads.

## 1.3 Configure and Build Sources

Follow these simple steps to configure Clang UPC:

<dl>
<dt>By using cmake:</dt><dd>
<pre>
mkdir bld; cd bld; cmake [options] path/to/src
</pre></dd>
<dt>By using configure:</dt><dd>
<pre>
mkdir bld; cd bld; path/to/src/configure [options]
</pre></dd>
</dl>

NOTE: _bld_ is a directory that holds the intermediate build products.
The _bld_ directory needs to be outside of the llvm source tree, but other
than that, itâ€™s arbitrary.

One of the common configuration options is directory prefix of
the installed compiler.  For example, cmake prefix option:

<pre>
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local
</pre>
And configure prefix option:
<pre>
 --prefix=/usr/local
</pre>

Run _make_ in the build directory to create Clang UPC executables
and libraries, and install the compiler in the desired place (by default
_/usr/local_).

<pre>
 make; make install
</pre>

<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Adding <i>make</i> option for parallel build
(e.g. <i>make -j8</i>) speeds up the build process.</p>

Please see the [configuration options](/clang-upc/config-options.html) for more
configuration options.
